# memory-decks

Quiz app written in React to learn memory decks (Mnemonica, Aronson, etc.)

There are a large number of magic tricks that can be performed with playing cards if you know the order of the cards upfront. You could of course just shuffle the cards and learn that specific order. However, there are special properties availble from the Mnemonica Stack (invented by Juan Tameriz) and the Aronson stack (invented by Simon Aronson).

This tool will help a person learn either of these stacks. Once mastered, an entire new category of tricks can be performed.
